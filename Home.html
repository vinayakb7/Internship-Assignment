        Classic period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]

        Chichen Itza was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through
        the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The
        site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc
        and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands.</div>

        ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
        Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined together
        by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many
        successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls.</div>

        Construction began under the emperor Vespasian (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in 80 AD under his
        successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r.

        amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre.</div>
